# OFFER-HUB Documentation

Welcome to the OFFER-HUB documentation. This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of the project, from the Orchestrator API to the frontend architecture.

## Documentation Overview

OFFER-HUB documentation is intentionally split by **audience**, not duplicated by accident:

| Location | Audience | Purpose | Format |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| `/docs/` | Contributors & maintainers | Internal engineering reference: implementation detail, architecture, standards | Markdown, read directly on GitHub |
| `/content/docs/` | External developers & integrators | Public docs website: how to use the API/SDK | MDX, rendered at offer-hub.tech/docs |
| `/src/content/` | End users (legal) | Static legal page copy (privacy policy, terms) | MDX, rendered directly by their page routes — not part of the docs site nav/search |

Some topics exist in both `/docs/guides/` and `/content/docs/guide/` (e.g. `escrow`, `orders`, `disputes`, `wallets`, `deposits`, `withdrawals`, `security`) — this is deliberate, not drift: the `/docs/` version explains how the Orchestrator implements the feature (state machine, signer roles, internal field names), while the `/content/docs/` version explains how an external integrator calls the public API/SDK. Each of these pairs cross-links to its counterpart at the top of the file so a reader who lands on the wrong audience's doc can find the right one.

Both `/docs/` and `/content/docs/` are indexed by the standalone [`mcp/`](../mcp/README.md) package — an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI assistants search and fetch this documentation directly. It's not part of the root npm workspace (there isn't one); it has its own `package.json` and is installed/run independently from `mcp/`.

For crawlers and assistants that don't speak MCP, the public docs site also serves `/llms.txt` (an index of `/content/docs/` per the [llms.txt convention](https://llmstxt.org/)) and `/llms-full.txt` (the full concatenated Markdown of every page), generated at request time from the same `content/docs/` source via `src/lib/mdx.ts`.

## Key Concepts

### Payment Flow
```
User deposits USDC → Creates order → Funds reserved
                                        ↓
                                   Escrow funded (on-chain)
                                        ↓
                                   Work delivered
                                        ↓
                               Release or Dispute
                                        ↓
                                   Funds transferred
```

### Balance Model
- **Available**: Can be used for orders or withdrawn
- **Reserved**: Locked for pending orders (before escrow funding)

### Authentication
- **API Keys**: Format `ohk_live_xxx` or `ohk_test_xxx`
- **Scopes**: `read`, `write`, `support`
- **NOT JWT**: API keys are stateless, no refresh tokens

### ID Prefixes
Defined in `packages/shared/src/constants/id-prefixes.ts` in the orchestrator repo. Format: `{prefix}_{nanoid(32)}`. The full table, including which resources are database-generated CUIDs instead, is on the [Data Model](./architecture/data-model.md) page.

| Entity | Prefix | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| User | `usr_` | `usr_abc123` |
| Order | `ord_` | `ord_xyz789` |
| Top-up | `topup_` | `topup_abc123` |
| Escrow | `esc_` | `esc_xyz789` |
| Dispute | `dsp_` | `dsp_jkl345` |
| Withdrawal | `wd_` | `wd_def456` |
| Event | `evt_` | `evt_ghi012` |
| Audit log | `aud_` | `aud_mno345` |
| API key | `key_` | `key_pqr678` |
| Marketplace | `mkt_` | `mkt_stu901` |
| Wallet | `wal_` | `wal_vwx234` |

## For AI Assistants

If you're an AI assistant working on this project:

1. **Read [AI Context](./ai-context.md)** first - contains critical project information
2. **Understand the dual-repo structure** - Orchestrator (backend) + Monorepo (frontend)
3. **API uses API Keys, NOT JWT** - Important for authentication code
4. **Neumorphic design system** - Follow the visual DNA guidelines
5. **State machines are strict** - Orders/escrow follow specific state transitions
6. **State machines reference** - Every domain machine is tabulated in the orchestrator repo at `docs/architecture/state-machines.md`, backed by `packages/shared/src/enums/`
